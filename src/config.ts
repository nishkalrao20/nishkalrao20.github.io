      description:
        "By introducing the notion of a quasi-local isolated horizon, we can construct the spacetime in the vicinity of a black hole horizon. This approach overcomes the limitations of event horizons and provides a natural framework for investigating near-horizon phenomena, which includes perturbative analyses of tidal deformability and post-merger dynamics.",

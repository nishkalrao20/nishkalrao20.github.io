A fundamental theory of quantum gravity remains the most significant open issue in theoretical physics. To illustrate the enigmatic nature of the quantum nature of gravity, consider a simple thought experiment, first with electromagnetism. Given a superposition of a positive and negative charge to you, which you attempt to maintain coherence for a long time. It is an extremely difficult task, since there exists an environment that decoheres the superposition because the degrees of freedom of the environment respond differently to each component of the superposition.

We expect that if a massive body is put in a quantum superposition of spatially separated states, the mere presence of a causal horizon in the vicinity of the body will eventually destroy the coherence of the superposition. This occurs because, in effect, the gravitational field of the body radiates soft gravitons into the horizon, allowing the black hole to acquire the differential information about the superposition.

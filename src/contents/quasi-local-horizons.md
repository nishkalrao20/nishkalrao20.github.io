A Black Hole is a collection of events that is causally disconnected from the rest of the universe. It is studied as a geometrical four-dimensional Riemannian manifold, which is part of spacetime. It is defined by the enigmatic Event Horizon, which serves as a boundary beyond which nothing can escape. Historically, black holes have been extensively studied through global methods and numerical relativity. The interplay between these approaches and the deep mathematics of topology and causality yields striking results, most notably the uniqueness theorems and their analogies with thermodynamics via the laws of black hole mechanics. However, the conventional characterization of black holes through event horizons, which is rooted in topology, encounters a teleological issue with non-locality. Defining the causal past requires knowledge extending to infinity, which complicates both practical applications and conceptual understanding. A productive paradigm shift studies quasi-local definitions, specifically _isolated_ and _dynamical_ horizons. By promoting the concept of a quasi-local isolated horizon and using its intrinsic geometry as initial data, it becomes possible to integrate the Einstein equations outward. This approach allows for the construction of the spacetime neighborhood around the horizon, thereby avoiding the issues associated with event horizons and creating a more natural framework.

### Introduction
On September 14, 2015, in the quiet hours of an otherwise ordinary morning in the United States, two LIGO detectors in Hanford and Livingston registered a signal unlike any seen before. That signal, labeled [**GW150914**](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102), was the advent of gravitational wave astronomy. A gravitational wave that traveled across the cosmos at the speed of light for nearly a billion years before reaching Earth provided us with the toolkit to unravel a newer perspective of our universe.

What began with that first whisper has grown into a chorus. Since GW150914, observatories around the world have recorded hundreds more gravitational-wave events, and detections now occur with a rate that was once unimaginable, often multiple times per week. Over the past decade, the LIGO and Virgo detectors have been made markedly more sensitive, and research laboratories worldwide are building and testing further upgrades to push sensitivity yet higher. 

As detectors grow more sensitive and surveys become deeper and longer, new challenges appear alongside new opportunities. One key challenge is **overlapping signals**: when two (or more) gravitational-wave strains arrive at close times and in similar frequency bands, their signals superpose in the detector output. 

Overlap can bias our inferences if it is not properly handled. Studies have shown that recovering one signal while neglecting a coincident or nearby signal can shift estimated parameters, reduce detection efficiency, and produce misleading confidence intervals. To address this, researchers are developing higher-dimensional, joint-inference techniques that attempt to model multiple overlapping sources simultaneously, along with practical mitigation strategies such as global-fit approaches, targeted subtraction of loud transients, and new search pipelines and machine-learning tools designed for dense signal populations. These efforts are essential: as the detectors improve and the event rate grows, robust statistical and computational methods will ensure we continue to turn faint ripples into reliable knowledge about the most extreme events in the universe.
